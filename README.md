# CommutesDontSuck

Get **exact commute times** instead of vague ranges. CommutesDontSuck tracks your routes at specific times and days to give you real traffic data based on actual conditions.

## What is CommutesDontSuck?

Traditional map apps show you estimated ranges like "25-45 minutes" which aren't helpful for planning. CommutesDontSuck solves this by:

1. **Recording real commute times** - The app checks your routes at the times you specify using Google Maps traffic data
2. **Building historical data** - Over time, you'll see patterns for each day and time
3. **Providing exact insights** - Know that your Monday 8am commute averages 32 minutes, not "25-45 minutes"

## Features

- **Route Management** - Add multiple routes with origin and destination addresses
- **Flexible Scheduling** - Set specific check times and days for each route
- **Traffic-Aware Data** - Uses Google Maps Directions API for real-time traffic conditions
